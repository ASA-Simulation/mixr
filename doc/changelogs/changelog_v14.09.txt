================================================================================
Changes since v14.01
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general

   1) Moved the declaration of LCreal from 'openeaagles/config.h' to
      'openeaagles/basic/support.h', since 'config.h' should only
      contain C pre-processor directives.

   2) Added std:: namespace qualifier to all string compare (strcmp) and exit calls
      This has no effect on API interface, but does make explicit where these functions
      are defined (for C++)

   3) Moving away from using C-style casts to more proper C++ casts throughout
      framework and examples.  No functional changes to the API or bugs have been found
      or resolved as a result of this activity.  We are simply adopting a better coding
      practice by making type casts more explicit in terms of the kind of cast being
      performed.

   4) Added 'const' in more places within functions and methods where an intermediate
      value is calculated to support other calculations.  These variables are often created
      and used as a matter of convenience and never intended to be altered again after
      initial calculation.  This coding style promotes better visibility as to the
      purpose of variable, and provides more information so the compiler can make better
      optimizations because it knows the value will never change after initial assignment.
      No functional changes to the API or bugs have been found or resolved as a result of
      this activity - again, this effort is a result of adopting better coding practices.

   5) Added shutdownNotification() function to several simulation classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic

   support.h
      1) Added explicit "std" namespace qualifiers and reducing the number
         of includes (e.g., cstdio, cstdlib, string)

   Field class
      1) setSlotHighlight() -- when clearing the highlight mode, now calling
         the proper clearDisplayMode() function (bug fix)

   Nav class
      1) convertLL2Utm() -- On term T9, changed second k1 to k2 (bug fix)

   Rotary class
      1) Removed the unused event() handler.

   Components class
      1) deleteData() -- added unref() for timingStats (bug fix)

   TcpHandler class
      1) recvData() was modified to check for closed connection or errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basicGL

   Image.cpp
      1) readFileBMP() -- Corrected the checks to properly reject files that are not
         bitmap files (bug fix) or other invalid files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dis

   NetIO class
      1) processElectromagneticEmissionPDU() -- changed to only attempt to process
      the PDU if there were handlers provided.

   Nib class
      1) Added shutdownNotification() function.

   EmissionPduHandler class
      1) deleteData() -- now sending SHUTDOWN_EVENT events to the sensor,
      sensorModel, and antennaModel before removing them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui-glut


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instruments

   Tape class
      1) copyData() now properly copies all of the class member variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maps


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
otw

   CigiClNetworkSignalProcessing class
      1) OnHotResp() -- added support for a CigiHatHotRespV3_2 type argument

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recorder


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation
 
   Autopilot class
      1) Removed old debug print statements
      2) getLeadPlayer() -- moved if statement ending bracket (bug fix)

   Datalink class
      1) clearQueues() -- bug fix when clearing the out queue

   NetIo class
      1) checkAndAddNtm() -- add unref() for newNode
      2) addNtmSorted(( -- add ref() for newNtm
      3) deleteData() -- removing 'tp'

   Otw class
      1) compareKey2Model() -- Corrected null pointer check on pKeyFedName (bug fix)

   Player class
      1) Added accessor to get initial velocity setting - this allows dynamics models
         to quiz Player as to what initial velocity setting is on reset().

   Simulation class
      1) reset() -- moved where simulation time is reset to the end of the function.
      2) Added a protected, non-const version of getTerrain()

   Station class
      1) setOwnshipByName() -- modified to properly unref() the player list when finished

   StabilizingGimbal class
      1) fixed slottable entry (bug fix)

   Weapon class
      1) release() -- now properly unref()'ing the 'initWpn' pointer
      2) reset() -- now checks if the launch vehicle pointer is zero before setting it
      3) crashNotification() and collisionNotification() both now check for local
         players and crash override off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vehicle

   Laero class
      1) Added reset method to initialize initial velocity using Player setting. This
         is effectively a bug fix as Player "initVelocity" was being ignored before
         (bug fix)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
