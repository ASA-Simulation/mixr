Changes since v11.08
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basicGL: 

    Display class
        1) There are now onMouseEnter() and onMouseExit() calls when we leave or
           enter the display.  This was implemented to support display of interest
           functionality.

        2) Display's ortho and viewport member variables are now private

    formFunc
        1) Added quads and triangle classes

    PushButton class
        1) Updated the state functions to have an initState variable, so it's much
           easier to see what state we started from, instead of just toggling the
           current state.  This is transparent to the user.

    Readouts class
        1) Added a preDrawSelectList variable under Rotary, which will allow us
           to draw the non-selected rotary graphical items before we select them.
           This fixes an irritating bug in which on the first selection of an item
           the graphic would "flicker", because it was being drawn for the first time.

    Shapes class
        1) Added two new classes, Quad and Triangle Quad - used for drawing quad
           strips or quads, with the ability to draw textures or gradients
           Triangle - draws either triangles, triangle fan, or triangle strips,
           with textures or gradients

    SymbolLoader class
        1) Added a new slot function, "interconnect", which will tell the symbol
           loader to draw lines between the symbols that it draws.  This is useful
           for drawing routes, etc.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui-glut:

    GlutDisplay class

        1) Added support for reshaping sub-windows as their main window is reshaped.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maps:

    CadrgFrame class
        1) Removed an un-used currentPos variable.

    VpfRecord class
        1) Under createRecord(), the begin, end, and mySize variables were changed
           from ints to std::streamoff, to remove warnings of type mismatch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

simulation: 
 
    Autopilot class
        1) Added an accessor function to return the anchor points of the
           autopilot's loiter pattern.  

    NetIO class
        1) Removed less than 0 checks for unsigned int's in four functions:
           getInputNib(x2) and getOutputNib(x2).
