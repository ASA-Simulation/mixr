General framework-wide changes/improvements

This release reflects a transition point for renaming of the project from OpenEaagles
to MIXR; the Mixed Reality Simulation Platform (or the Mixer Platform). The use of
the specific term 'platform' vs 'framework' is intentional, as it's an indicator
that this project is oriented at supporting the development of a wider range of
applications then the term 'framework' implies.

No API changes have been made during this renaming effort.  The only
changes made concern the naming of include file paths (e.g., 
#include "mixr/base/Object.hpp' as opposed to #include "openeaagles/base/Object.hpp"),
namespace (i.e., 'namespace mixr' as opposed to 'namespace oe'), and compiled libraries
(e.g., 'libmixr_base' as opposed to 'liboe_base').

The move from OpenEaagles v17.06a to MIXR v17.06c should be relatively painless, as
adjustment to changes can mostly be made with simple search and replace commands.

Rationale for name change:
-- From OpenEaagles to Mixed Reality Simulation Platform
-- This project provides lots of support for building highly interactive (real-time)
   simulation applications, that often include graphics and interoperability interfaces.
   Given it is not oriented at gaming, meaning, the creation of applications for
   entertainment, but oriented at more serious concerns, we felt it appropriate
   to align project name with the domain for which it offers strong support
   (i.e., mixed reality applications).

Note concerning examples:
There have been a few fixes made to examples that decode I/O switches.
