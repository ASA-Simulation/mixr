# Angles
#---------------

The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty

All constants were collected via the internet from
http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/outside.html
National Institute of Technology Standards website.

Note: Since all Angles are based in Semicircles, all conversions will either convert
to or from semicircles.

#---------------
# Area
#---------------

These constants were obtained from the following websites, and are assumed
accurate as of 2/5/03.

Note: All Decibel conversions came from the radar detection system PowerPoint presentation
slides 47 and 48.

#---------------
# Frequency
#---------------

All metric conversions were based on the conversion tables found in
the Transportation Energy Data Book: Edition 22 - 2002, which can be found out
http://www-cta.ornl.gov/cta/data/tedb22/Edition22_AppendixB.pdf

Note: Since all frequency classes are based in hertz, all conversions will either
convert to or from hertz.

Note: Since all units are converted to or from KiloGrams, only those constants
will be defined.
